# Facial-emotion-recognition-using-keras-using-keras
The objective is to classify each face based on the live emotion shown in the facial expression.

Description:
Used opencv to detect the face and then Convolution neural
networks to classify the face based on expression. The application was
implemented using Keras(tensorflow backend). Image augmentation,
Convolution, Pooling, Flattering, Deep neural network were the key
highlights of this project.
